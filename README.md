Click2Glow â€” Wireless LED/Bulb Control System with Web Interface (ESP8266 NodeMCU)
Jul 2024

Designed and developed a wireless, real-time LED and appliance control system using an ESP8266 NodeMCU microcontroller and relay modules. Built a responsive web-based interface hosted directly on the ESP8266 to allow users to toggle lights and appliances remotely over Wi-Fi. The system is scalable for smart home and industrial automation applications, providing low-latency, on-demand switching without requiring external servers or cloud services.

Key Features:

Hosted a fully functional web server on NodeMCU using the ESP8266WiFi library.

Enabled GPIO control via HTTP requests using custom web-based buttons.

Real-time status display and state management for connected devices.

Supports integration into home automation setups, industrial control systems, and IoT projects.

Demonstrated potential for remote operation, monitoring, and basic Git automation for firmware updates.
